[482. License Key Formatting](https://leetcode.com/problems/license-key-formatting/)
You are given a license key represented as a string S which consists only alphanumeric character and dashes.
The string is separated into N+1 groups by N dashes.
Given a number K, we would want to reformat the strings such that each group contains exactly K characters,
except for the first group which could be shorter than K, but still must contain at least one character.
Furthermore, there must be a dash inserted between two groups and all lowercase letters should be converted to \
uppercase. Given a non-empty string S and a number K, format the string according to the rules described above.

Example 1:
Input: S = "5F3Z-2e-9-w", K = 4
Output: "5F3Z-2E9W"
Explanation: The string S has been split into two parts, each part has 4 characters.
Note that the two extra dashes are not needed and can be removed.

Example 2:
Input: S = "2-5g-3-J", K = 2
Output: "2-5G-3J"
Explanation: The string S has been split into three parts, each part has 2 characters except the first part as it could be shorter as mentioned above.

Note:
The length of string S will not exceed 12,000, and K is a positive integer.
String S consists only of alphanumerical characters (a-z and/or A-Z and/or 0-9) and dashes(-).
String S is non-empty.
